# jet-esp-aimbot
THIS IS NOT MY OWN.  i am just updating it to our current patch
in order to use this go to your jet directory C:\Jet-AIO\EscapeFromTarkov_Data or wherever you installed yours. and merge the 2 managed folders
BACK UP YOUR OWN ASSEMBLY.CSHARP cuz otherwise your gonna have to download the game all over again to get the original if u dislike the cheat. i will eventually upload 1 here to save hassle.

there are some issues with the hud not always dissapearing. only fix is just restarting the game unfortunately. 

keybinds!
Aimbot = left ctrl
door unlocker = num4 / kinda buggy may crash may not if u dont have a numpad. rest in piece may your soul im going to try change it cuz i unfortunately dont have 1 xD


where i got it from https://github.com/NoClueWhoIAm/EmuTarkov_ESP_Plus

credits to TheMaoci who first originally made this possible the guy above just changed it and gave no credit and i just changed the version to match our patch
