# jet-esp-aimbot
THIS IS NOT MY OWN.  i am just updating it to our current patch
in order to use this go to your jet directory C:\Jet-AIO\EscapeFromTarkov_Data or wherever you installed yours. and merge the 2 managed folders
BACK UP YOUR OWN ASSEMBLY.CSHARP cuz otherwise your gonna have to download the game all over again to get the original if u dislike the cheat. i will eventually upload 1 here to save hassle.

there are some issues with the hud not always dissapearing. only fix is just restarting the game unfortunately. 

keybinds: Open any locked doors with NUM4 / aimbot is left ctrl. (i may look to change the aimbot button if enough people want me to or you can do it yourself by editing the cheat.dll

where i got it from https://github.com/NoClueWhoIAm/EmuTarkov_ESP_Plus

credits to TheMaoci who first originally made this possible the guy above just changed it and gave no credit and i just changed the version to match our patch
